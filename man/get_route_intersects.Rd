\title{Getting the polygons or route intersects}
\usage{
get_route_intersects(routes, polygon, inverse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{routes}{An sf linesegment object representing routes of multiple
source-destination points}

\item{polygon}{The polygon as geographic coordinate system we wanted to find
whether the routes have intersected or not}

\item{inverse}{The default is FALSE. If FALSE, returns a list of routes length
and contains the indices of the polygon that intersected with the routes. If
TRUE then returns a list of polygon and contains the indices of the routes that
intersected with polygon.}
}
\value{
A list of vectors where a polygon has intersected with a given route.
Each vector in the list represents the series of polygons that has  route has
intersected and vice versa for routes.
}
\description{
This function gets the vector of the polygon ids or codes where a given route
is intersected
